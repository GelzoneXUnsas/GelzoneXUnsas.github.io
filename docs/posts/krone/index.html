    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Krone is a song from the original soundtrack of the anime series Guilty Crown, and it holds a special place in my heart as it has greatly impacted my life in several ways. Before delving into the song itself, I want to talk about the anime Guilty Crown and how it has <strong>shaped</strong> me as a person.</p>
<h3 id="about-guilty-crown">About Guilty Crown</h3>
<p>The series Guilty Crown is set in a dystopian Japan, where a mysterious virus has wiped out most of the population, and a powerful organization known as the &ldquo;GHQ&rdquo; has taken control of the government. The series follows the story of a high school student named Shu Ouma, who is given a powerful weapon known as the &ldquo;Power of Kings&rdquo; which allows him to extract the &ldquo;voids&rdquo; from other people and use them as weapons. The series is a mix of action, drama, and science fiction, and the song &ldquo;Krone&rdquo; perfectly captures the emotions of the series.</p>
<p>Guilty Crown is my all-time favorite anime, and it has had a significant impact on my life. I love the series for its compelling story, well-developed characters, and its stunning animation. The series also shaped me in three different ways. Firstly, the composer of the anime, <a href="https://www.sawanohiroyuki.com/">Hiroyuki Sawano</a>, introduced me to music production and sparked my interest in creating my own music. Secondly, the main character, <a href="https://guiltycrown.fandom.com/wiki/Inori_Yuzuriha">Inori</a>, inspired me to explore the world of character design and voice casting. <del>I tried not to be simp but I love this character to death!</del></p>
<p><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d6/19/72/d6197264c9233edf3c1a6856c7ad1fef.png" alt="Inori"></p>
<p>Lastly, the heavy use of acoustic guitar in the anime&rsquo;s background music (BGM) led me to practice fingerstyle guitar.</p>

</div>

<p>Coming to the song &ldquo;Krone&rdquo; itself, it is a powerful and emotional track that perfectly captures the essence of the series. The original song&rsquo;s melody is haunting, featuring a mix of electronic beats, orchestral instruments, and powerful vocals. In my arrangement, I changed the song to a slow-paced emotional piece together with changed my shot to outside environment. The song starts with a gentle and mellow piano melody, accompanied by a soft and soothing vocal. As the song progresses, the melody builds up gradually, adding layers of instrumentation.</p><ul class="pa0">
