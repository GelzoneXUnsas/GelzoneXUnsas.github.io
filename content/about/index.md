Hello there! My name is **Lucas Li**, also known as **Gelzone Unsas** in the online world. I am a multi-talented individual who is passionate about programming, game development in particular, and music production.

[Programming](https://github.com/GelzoneXUnsas) is my main area of expertise, and I am always on the lookout for new ways to improve my skills and knowledge. Game development is a particular interest of mine, as it offers endless possibilities to create innovative and immersive experiences. My undergraduate and master studies in Computer Science have provided me with a strong foundation in programming and software development, and I am excited to collaborate with peers to push the boundaries of what is possible in game development.

Aside from programming, I am also an accomplished [music producer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_AJP0KDnVPcPugtp6k37Q), with a focus on fingerstyle guitar. I am fascinated by the emotional power of music and strive to incorporate my passion for music into my programming work. Sound design and optimization in game development are particularly interesting to me, as they can enhance the immersive experience for players and create a deeper emotional connection between the player and the game.

As an avid anime lover, I am inspired by the depth and creativity of the stories and characters found in anime. I believe that anime can be a powerful source of inspiration for creating meaningful and engaging games, and I am excited to explore the potential of anime in my [programming work](https://gelzonexunsas.github.io/posts/games/virtuosos/).

Thank you for taking the time to read about me and my interests. Please feel free to reach out and connect with me!
