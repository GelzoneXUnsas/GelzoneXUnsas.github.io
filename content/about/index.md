Hello! I'm **Lucas Li**, or as I'm known online, **Gelzone Unsas**. I’m a game developer and music producer passionate about combining my love for both programming and music to create something meaningful — like Ongawa, my latest project that aims to help indie musicians showcase their music through interactive gaming.

I’ve always been drawn to the creative freedom of game development and programming. It lets me merge my technical background, gained from my undergraduate and master’s studies in Computer Science, with my love for storytelling and music. With [Ongawa](https://www.ongawa.io/), I’m blending [music production](https://www.youtube.com/@GelzoneUnsas) and [programming](https://github.com/GelzoneXUnsas) to build a platform where indie artists can turn their songs into immersive, rhythm-based game levels.

Outside of coding, I’m a fingerstyle guitar enthusiast and a huge fan of anime. The emotional depth I find in music and the creative storytelling in anime constantly fuel my work. I’m always looking for new ways to create experiences that not only entertain but also connect on a deeper level.

Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect!
