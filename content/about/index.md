My name is Lucas Li, but you may know me by my online name, Gelzone Unsas. I am a multi-faceted individual with a passion for programming, music production, and game development.

As a programmer, I am constantly seeking new ways to improve my skills and knowledge. I am particularly interested in game development and the endless possibilities it offers. My undergraduate studies and senior project in Computer Science have provided me with a strong foundation in programming and software development. I am eager to work with my peers to explore new and innovative ways of creating games that push the boundaries of what is possible.

In addition to my programming skills, I am also an accomplished music producer, with a focus on fingerstyle guitar. I have always been fascinated by the power of music to evoke emotions and create powerful experiences. I am always looking for ways to incorporate my passion for music into my work as a programmer. I am particularly interested in sound design and sound optimization in game development. I believe that these technologies have the potential to revolutionize the way that games are designed and played. By creating an immersive audio environment, we as game developers can create an emotional connection between the player and the game.

As an anime lover, I have always been struck by the depth and creativity of the stories and characters that are found in anime. I believe that anime can be a powerful tool for creating compelling and meaningful games, and I am excited to explore the potential of anime as a source of inspiration for my work as a programmer.
