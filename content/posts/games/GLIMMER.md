### Technical Details

The development of GLIMMER involved several key components, from boundary-based dissolving effects to a dynamic lighting system, custom collectibles, and UI design. Below are some of the technical highlights:

#### Boundary-Based Dissolve

One of the primary mechanics in GLIMMER is the **boundary-based dissolve effect**, where objects dissolve into view as players approach them. The logic for this feature is handled by a coroutine that calculates the distance between the player and objects, gradually adjusting the dissolve strength of the material shader.

```csharp
public IEnumerator ShowBoundary()
{
    float distanceToPlayer = Vector3.Distance(playerCollider.ClosestPoint(transform.position), objectCollider.ClosestPoint(player.transform.position));
    float dissolveStrength = Mathf.Clamp01(distanceToPlayer / dissolveDistance);
    dissolveStrength = Mathf.Clamp(dissolveStrength, 0.4f, 0.75f); 
    mat.SetFloat("_DissolveStrength", dissolveStrength);
    yield return null;
}
```

This effect contributes to the atmospheric immersion, enhancing the sense of exploration by hiding or revealing elements based on player proximity.

#### Collectibles System

![](/images/games/glimmer_screenshot_3.png)

GLIMMER includes an extensive **collectibles system**, where players can interact with and unlock different objects in the environment, such as notes, images, sounds, and videos. Each collectible follows a base class structure that allows for easy addition of new item types.

```csharp
public abstract class Collectible : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] protected string Title;
    [SerializeField] protected string Body;
    public abstract void OpenWindow(GameObject canvas);
}
```

Specific collectibles like **Node**, **Picture**, **Video**, and **Sound** all extend this class, providing unique interactions depending on the object type. For example, the `Node` class shows detailed descriptions and questions when activated, while the `Picture` class displays imagery.

#### Dynamic Lighting System

GLIMMER's world is brought to life with a **dynamic lighting system**, where light intensity is controlled based on the player's distance to light sources. The system ensures that lights gradually dim or brighten as the player moves closer or further away, enhancing the game's immersive feel.

```csharp
public class DistanceBasedLightIntensity : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float minDistance = 1f;
    public float maxDistance = 10f;
    void Update()
    {
        float distance = Vector3.Distance(transform.position, targetObject.position);
        distance = Mathf.Clamp(distance, minDistance, maxDistance);
        float intensity = Mathf.Lerp(minIntensity, maxIntensity, Mathf.InverseLerp(minDistance, maxDistance, distance));
        targetLight.intensity = intensity;
    }
}
```

#### UI and Map System

To aid player navigation, GLIMMER features an **interactive map** and a **help panel**. The map shows collectible locations and is dynamically updated based on the player's progress. The UI also allows for smooth transitions between panels, using the `LeanTween` library for animation effects.

```csharp
public class OpenMap : MonoBehaviour
{
    public GameObject panel; 
    void Update()
    {
        if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.M))
        {
            panel.SetActive(!panel.activeSelf);
        }
    }
}
```

#### WebGL Integration

The game is designed to be fully playable in **WebGL**, ensuring that no downloads are necessary, making it easily accessible for desktop browsers. Special attention was given to optimizing the gameâ€™s assets and code for WebGL compatibility, including video players and custom interactions.
