The Theme for **Ludum Dare 53** was **Delivery**. I made a game about joke delivery within **48** hours with a few of my colleagues called [Robolol](https://kanaz312.itch.io/robolol). Robolol is a party game in which players compete to tell the best joke to the audience.

### Gameplay

Players take on the role of a comedian who must collaborate with a rusty and lonely robot to construct a joke from its word bank. The robot then tells the **joke** to the audience, and players can alter its **voice** (speed, tone, range, and so on) to make the joke sound more amusing.

The game is intended to be entertaining and engaging, with an emphasis on writing hilarious jokes that will make the audience laugh. To find the perfect joke, players can try out different combinations of words and voices.

Robolol is a game about a rusted and lonely robot that was abandoned by its creator. The robot comes with a large library of words and phrases that players can use to construct a joke. The main function of the robot is to deliver the joke to the audience, while players adjust the robot’s voice to make the joke sound funny.

### Controls

The game is played using **mouse** to interact and select words to use in the joke. Players can click on the robot to access its library of words and select the ones they want to use. The game also allows players to adjust the robot’s voices using a variety of different sliders and settings.

### Last Words

Team has come together once again! Despite the challenges we faced with midterms, projects, and labs, we still managed to pull through and complete our game.  Made for [Ludum Dare 53](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/53).
