The piece 「君の知らない物語」 is a song by supercell, a Japanese pop group, and is the opening theme song for the anime series 「化物語」. It is a special anime to me. It has a special place in my heart, and that's why I spent a lot of time preparing a fingerstyle arrangement and music video for the song. <!--more-->

### About the Anime

One of the most impressive aspects of Monogatari is its storytelling. The series is masterfully crafted, with a complex and multi-layered narrative that keeps the viewer engaged from beginning to end. The series also explores a wide range of themes and topics, including love, loss, identity, and the meaning of life, making it a thought-provoking and meaningful watch.

Another aspect that sets Monogatari apart is its unique art style. The animation is visually stunning, with interesting use of colors, and imaginative designs that bring the world of Monogatari to life. The series also uses a variety of animation techniques, such as rotoscoping and still shots, to create a truly unique viewing experience.

Lastly, I really appreciate the depth of the Monogatari series. The series is not just a collection of stories, but a journey through the characters' minds and emotions. The series explores the complexities of their relationships. This depth makes the series much more than just an entertaining watch, but a thought-provoking and meaningful experience.

### About the Arrangement

Preparing the fingerstyle arrangement was a labor of love. I spent hours practicing and perfecting each note, making sure that my interpretation of the song was true to the original tab while also adding my own personal touch. 

Creating the music video was also a challenge, but one that I was eager to take on. It was a freezing winter night, and I started off by chopping wood. I wanna to set up a warm fire to mimic the feeling I have while listening to the original song. The fire crackles and pops, the stars twinkle in the sky, like a million diamonds scattered across a bed of black velvet. The night is quiet, with only the occasional sound of the fire breaking the stillness. Despite the peaceful and warm ambiance depicted in the music video, the reality of recording the video was far from cozy. The winter night was cold and biting, and my fingers were numb from the cold. Playing the guitar was a challenge, as my fingers struggled to maintain their dexterity in the freezing temperatures.

But aside from this, it was a moment that I will never forget. After months of hard work and dedication, my fingerstyle arrangement and music video caught the attention of Tam Lu, the original composer of the song. I was overjoyed to hear that he not only watched my video, but that he actually liked it!
