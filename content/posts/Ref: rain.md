It always brings me a good mood when I'm inside my house and it's raining outside. I enjoy the gentle pitter-patter of the raindrops, the fresh scent of the earth, and the soothing sound of the rain, everything work together to create a calming and peaceful atmosphere. The song「Ref: **rain**」 gives me the same type of beauty. <!--more-->

### About the Anime

_let the rain washes away the old and the negative,_

_leaving behind a fresh start and a renewed spirit._

As one of the upcoming animes in that season, it soon draw my attention by its trailer opening song and art style. 「恋は雨上がりのように」 "Love is Like After the Rain" is a romantic drama anime that explores the relationship between a 17-year-old high school student named Akira Tachibana and a 45-year-old manager of a family restaurant named Masami Kondou. Many of the scenes involve raining, which has a romantic quality, as it brings people together. It's a natural phenomenon that can be enjoyed with someone you love, and creates an opportunity to share a special moment.

In my arrangement, I tried to create a lush and intricate soundscape that can effectively convey the slow-paced, introspective mood of the anime. By incorporating the feel of "after rain," I added additional layers of meaning to the piece. The peacefulness and serenity that come after a rainstorm are often seen as a symbol of renewal and hope, and incorporating these feelings enhances the emotional impact of the song.
