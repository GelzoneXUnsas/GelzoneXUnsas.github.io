Krone is a song from the original soundtrack of the anime series Guilty Crown, and it holds a special place in my heart as it has greatly impacted my life in several ways. Before delving into the song itself, I want to talk about the anime Guilty Crown and how it has **shaped** me as a person. <!--more-->

### About Guilty Crown
The series Guilty Crown is set in a dystopian Japan, where a mysterious virus has wiped out most of the population, and a powerful organization known as the "GHQ" has taken control of the government. The series follows the story of a high school student named Shu Ouma, who is given a powerful weapon known as the "Power of Kings" which allows him to extract the "voids" from other people and use them as weapons. The series is a mix of action, drama, and science fiction, and the song "Krone" perfectly captures the emotions of the series.

Guilty Crown is my all-time favorite anime, and it has had a significant impact on my life. I love the series for its compelling story, well-developed characters, and its stunning animation. The series also shaped me in three different ways. Firstly, the composer of the anime, [Hiroyuki Sawano](https://www.sawanohiroyuki.com/), introduced me to music production and sparked my interest in creating my own music. Secondly, the main character, [Inori](https://guiltycrown.fandom.com/wiki/Inori_Yuzuriha), inspired me to explore the world of character design and voice casting. ~~I tried not to be simp but I love this character to death!~~

Lastly, the heavy use of acoustic guitar in the anime's background music (BGM) led me to practice fingerstyle guitar.

Coming to the song "Krone" itself, it is a powerful and emotional track that perfectly captures the essence of the series. The original song's melody is haunting, featuring a mix of electronic beats, orchestral instruments, and powerful vocals. In my arrangement, I changed the song to a slow-paced emotional piece together with changed my shot to outside environment. The song starts with a gentle and mellow piano melody, accompanied by a soft and soothing vocal. As the song progresses, the melody builds up gradually, adding layers of instrumentation.
