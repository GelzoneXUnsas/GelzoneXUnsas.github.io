When I reflect on my music production journey, I realize that a significant portion of my earlier compositions were heavily influenced by the film and television works that I loved. Watching these works ignited my passion for music and motivated me to want to create my own compositions that reflected the **emotions** and themes of the stories I loved. <!--more-->

The incredible short film Shelter is one of these examples:

Here is the letter Rin saw in the end of the film :(
```
To Rin
From : Dad
    "There was just so little time left after you were born.
    I don't know how much love I managed to pour into raising you after your mother died...
    But your smile kept me going. (^_^)
    I would like to have come with you, but I couldn't.
    I wanted you to forget everything and move on... I knew you'd be alright.
    But you'll get lonely, and remember.
    I know you'll grow strong, and read this letter some day.
    I really wish we could have spent more time together. I'm sorry.
    You were so young back then, too young to understand what they meant. So let me repeat...
    My final words to you."
```

Here is my version of the song...

Looking back, it was a valuable experience that has shaped my music and my approach to creating it, and I am grateful for it.
