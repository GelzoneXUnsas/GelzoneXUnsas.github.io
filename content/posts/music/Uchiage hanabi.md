The song 「[打ち上げ花](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7jkZbd7cPA)」is from the movie **Firework**, which is the same director for the film 「Your Name.」I watched the movie right after it came out since I'm a big fan of Makoto Shinkai, and the soft and gentle melody captured my heart.<!--more-->

### About the Anime

The lyrics of the song are about one who is watching a fireworks display, and how it brings back memories of the past and of lost loved ones. Despite its popularity, I think the song's movie Firework is not as well-received as the movie "Your Name." The firework movie lacks the same level of quality, both in terms of depth and storytelling. The animation is fluid and detailed, but the story is not as compelling or touching.

I recorded the video near my family's country yard in Beijing when I went back for summer vacation. Just as in the movie, we were celebrating, barbecuing, telling stories, and reflecting on memories in that summer night.
