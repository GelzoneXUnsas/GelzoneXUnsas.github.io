I first got to know「[**アヤノの幸福理論**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suToSl5BtvM)」(Ayano's Theory of Happiness) as one of my favorite songs from the anime 「MekakuCity Actors」, but it is actually part of the larger multimedia project called 「Kagerou Project」, which includes various songs, light novels, manga, and a video game. <!--more--> The project was created by Jin, the composer of the song, and it follows the story of a group of teenagers who possess supernatural abilities.

### About the Anime

In the project's story, the group of teenagers are called "Mekakushi Dan". Each member of the Mekakushi Dan has their own unique ability, and the story follows their adventures and struggles. 「**Mekakucity Actors**」 is an anime version of the 「**Kagerou Project**」 that aired in 2014. The animation tells the narrative of the Mekakushi Dan and includes many of the project's songs, notably "Ayano's Theory of Happiness." The anime also features additional characters and story elements not included in the original idea.

In episode 9 of 「Mekakucity Actors」, titled 「Ayano's Theory of Happiness」, the story and music come together to create a touching and emotional experience for the audience. The episode centers around the backstory of Ayano Tateyama, the leader of the Mekakushi Dan, and the events that led to her tragic death. As the episode nears its conclusion, the music crescendos, leaving us with a sense of both grief and optimism as we witness the creation of the Mekakushi Dan and the legacy that Ayano left behind.

### About the Arrangement

As I strummed my guitar amidst the pink and white blossoms under my house, I couldn't help but feel a sense of peace and contentment. My fingerstyle arrangement of the song was finally complete, and it felt like the perfect complement to the haunting melody of the original vocaloid song.

Despite the fact that the original song was composed almost entirely of synthesizers, I was confident that my guitar version would capture the same emotional depth and complexity With harmonies, addition of strings and other instruments, it really added a sense of grandeur and drama to the piece.

Of course, none of this would have been possible without the stunning visuals provided by the anime clip. I had scoured the internet for hours trying to find the perfect footage to accompany my music, and when I finally stumbled upon the blue ray version, I knew that my search was over (in comparsion with the original).
