「[**コイワズライ**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP-Ouq_KWGk)」(Koiwazurai) is a lovely song by the talented Japanese singer **Aimer**, who is noted for her mesmerizing voice and emotive performances. As one of my favorite music video arrangements that I've created, I specifically focused on visual details and I am pleased with how it turned out. <!--more--> As an admirer of her work, I recently arranged her work for the second time (previous cover [「Ref: rain」](https://gelzonexunsas.github.io/posts/music/ref-rain/)), attempting to convey the essence of Aimer's artistry. 

### About the Song

{{< youtube hrNYbbdKNSA>}}

Personally, I think the studio recorded version of this song is the best. For instance, when it comes to songs that have an **upbeat tempo but depressing** lyrics, 「コイワズライ」 really stands out as an excellent example. It's fascinating how the contrast creates such a powerful effect. Sometimes, sad lyrics with slow and gloomy music can feel a bit cliché or overdone. But, when you take a really bouncy, happy song and infuse it with heartbreak and loss, it creates an interesting juxtaposition that adds new depth to the lyrics. It's a unique way of presenting the message and can make for a truly captivating listening experience.

### About the Arrangement

{{< youtube sP-Ouq_KWGk >}}

One technique I utilized was adjusting the shutter speed to create **string oscillations** on the guitar to add a unique and visually interesting element. To create string oscillations on a guitar in a music video, I adjusted the shutter speed of the camera to capture the movement of the strings. A higher shutter speed can freeze the movement of the strings, while a lower shutter speed can blur the movement and create a visually interesting effect.

Additionally, I also played around with the color grading to give it a more Japanese-style look, which further enhances the overall aesthetic of the video. In general, the **Japanese-style color grading** I'm looking for often involves muted, earthy tones and a desaturated color palette. So I tried adding film grain and other textures to give it a more vintage feel.
