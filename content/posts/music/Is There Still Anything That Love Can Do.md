「[愛にできることはまだあるかい](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p3ty6pObmM)」(Is There Still Anything That Love Can Do), another song featured in the film 「**天気の子**」(Weathering with You), is one of my favorite arrangement so far. <!--more-->

### About the Anime

![](https://images5.alphacoders.com/100/1003363.jpg)

The plot revolves around a young boy named Hodaka who flees his small town for Tokyo, where he meets Hina, a girl with the ability to control the weather. They start a business that provides people with clear skies in exchange for money. As I was a bit upset about the previous Shinkai's film, in comparison to "Fireworks," "Weathering with You" is more emotionally grounded and character-driven.

### About the Arrangement

{{< youtube 5p3ty6pObmM >}}

I am often attracted to songs with a complex and atmospheric arrangement with multiple layers. This song is an excellent example of such a composition, and it strikes a deep chord with me. The complexity and depth of the chord sequence employed in this song lends an added layer of emotion to the music, which I especially like.

The chord sequence is an ingenious blend of minor and major chords that produces tension and release throughout the song. The usage of seventh chords (such as Am7, Dm7, and G7) adds a layer of intricacy to the progression, lending refinement and maturity to the song. In the verse, the progression includes a chromatic **descending** bass line (from Am7 to Dm7 to G7 to Cmaj7), which lends momentum and direction to the melody.
