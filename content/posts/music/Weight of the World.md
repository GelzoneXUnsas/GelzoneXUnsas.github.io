**「[Weight of the World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKjzGS1nS40)」** is a song featured in my favorite game at all time, the 2017 video game **NieR: Automata**, developed by PlatinumGames and published by Square Enix. This piece serves as the main theme for NieR: Automata, and plays during the game's opening and ending credits, as well as during several key moments in the game's story.<!--more-->

### About the Game

The game's story is truly impressive, and it delves into complex philosophical themes such as the nature of consciousness, the value of life, and the meaning of existence. It also explores themes of compassion, trauma, and freedom, which give the story a depth and emotional resonance that few other games can match. NieR: Automata features multiple endings, each offering a different perspective on the game's story and characters. Within a total of 26 endings, Ending **E** is unlocked after the player has completed the game's first four endings, and it presents a unique and emotionally powerful conclusion to the game's story.

In ending **E**, you're given a choice to sacrifice their own save data to help another player who is struggling with the game's final boss battle. This choice is presented as a metaphor for the game's themes of sacrifice, compassion, and interconnectedness. If you chooses to help, they are treated to a special ending that features an uplifting message of hope and perseverance. The ending features a touching credit sequence that encourages you to never give up, to keep fighting even in the face of adversity, and to always strive to be their best selves. The sequence is accompanied by a new vocal version of the game's main theme, 「Weight of the World」, which adds to the emotional impact of the ending.

The game's music, composed by **Keiichi Okabe**, is widely regarded as one of the best video game soundtracks of all time. The music is a perfect complement to the game's themes and storyline, and it adds depth and emotion to every scene. The game also features some memorable vocal tracks, including 「Weight of the World」, which serve as the game's main theme and encapsulates the game's themes of hope, despair, and perseverance. Here is a biography of Keiichi Okabe (who established the music production studio MONACA, the same studio for Monogatari series' OST) which was one of my inspiration when it comes to music production.


### About the Arrangement

{{< youtube DKjzGS1nS40 >}}

The video was shot nearby a place I was living in back then, at a small town called Turlock, California. I chosed a forest setting that matches the themes of the song and the game, which help to create a sense of connection and resonance between the music and the visuals. The forbidden forest theme can be particularly effective in this regard, as it helps to create a sense of danger and mystery that perfectly matches the emotional depth of the song.

By incorporating different instruments and utilizing effective mixing techniques, I tried to make the arrangement to give the song an added sense of personality, and to showcase the song's emotional depth and complex layers. Adding in a violin help to bring out the melody and emotional resonance of the vocal track, while incorporating percussion help to create a sense of momentum and drive in the arrangement. The mixing of the arrangement was also a critical component in creating an emotional and hollow feeling that matches the song's themes.
By playing around with different levels of reverb and EQ, the arrangement create an ethereal and otherworldly atmosphere that matches the song's sense of longing and melancholy.
