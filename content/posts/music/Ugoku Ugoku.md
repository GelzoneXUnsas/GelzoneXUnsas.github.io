### About the Anime

「少女終末旅行」 is a post-apocalyptic anime that tells the story of two young girls, Chito and Yuuri, as they wander through the ruins of a world that has been destroyed by war where the remnants of society are barely clinging to life. Despite the bleakness of the show's world, "Girls' Last Tour" is a heartwarming and uplifting story about the power of friendship and the resilience of the human spirit. 

I realized that the post-apocalyptic genre is appealing to me a lot of the times because of its theme of nature and loneliness. It often deals with the theme of nature taking over to create a sense of beauty in the midst of chaos, as we're are forced to navigate and interact with the natural world in new and often unexpected ways. Isolation and loneliness often comes with it. With society having collapsed,  we're often left to our own devices, without the influence of others, which can lead to moments of introspection, self-discovery, and contemplation.

The show's depiction of the aftermath of war is both haunting and beautiful. The empty landscapes and ruined buildings are a testament to the destructive power of conflict, yet there is also a sense of beauty in the way that nature has reclaimed the land. I'm planning to use this theme as an inspiration for a coming-up game of mine.


### About the Arrangement

The music video featuring another Tam Lu's arrangement with some of my changes. The arrangement I used included some challenging harmonic techniques, but I was able to master them through dedicated practice. To add an extra layer of visual interest to the video, I also experimented with using After Effects to create an audio spectrum in the scene. The effect worked beautifully, adding to the overall upbeat and cheerful vibe of the song.
