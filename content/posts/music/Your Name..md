The [Your Name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0qWktYUUwI&list=PLOEPzbk-HpuTJG8m5pvBNIzmIPGMAqXTc&pp=gAQB) series holds a special place in my **early music production** journey. I was first introduced to the series through the anime film Your Name, and it left such an impact on me that I decided to start creating my own music. <!--more-->

Initially, I only used YouTube as a cloud storage platform to store and share my creations. However, as I received more and more positive and constructive feedback, I began to see the potential of YouTube as a platform for sharing my interests and expressing myself.

### About the Film
Your Name.「君の名は。」is a 2016 Japanese anime film directed by Makoto Shinkai. The film is about two high school students, Taki and Mitsuha, who live in different parts of Japan. They begin to experience a strange phenomenon where they switch bodies with each other, and they must work together to figure out how and why this is happening.

### Your Name. Series
There are **3 songs** I made regarding the film using other's arrangements. RADWIMPS is a Japanese rock band that provided the original soundtrack for Your Name. 

#### Zen Zen Zense 「前前前世」

"Zen Zen Zense," is a play on words in Japanese, meaning "past, present, and future." The lyrics of the song reflect on the theme of time and how it connects the two main characters, Taki and Mitsuha in the film. The lyrics express the longing and nostalgia that the characters feel for each other, even though they are living in different times and places.

#### Nandemonaiya 「なんでもないや」

"Nandemonaiya" is a ballad that is sung by the main characters of the film, Taki and Mitsuha, and it is used as a theme song for their relationship and the connection they share. As one of my first songs involved singing, I was nervous and scared.

#### Mitsuha's Theme「三葉のテーマ」

As one of the less popular song in the film, I like this piece the most. "Mitsuha's Theme" is a beautiful and emotional track that perfectly captures the essence of the character Mitsuha. The song starts with a gentle piano melody accompanied by a soft and soothing vocal, it builds up to an emotional climax that reflects Mitsuha's longing and longing for a connection.
