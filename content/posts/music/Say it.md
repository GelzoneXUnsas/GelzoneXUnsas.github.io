「**言って。**」(Say it) is a song by the Japanese duo Yorushika, consisting of vocalist **n-buna** and guitarist **suis**. The song was released on December 5, 2019, as part of their album "Plagiarism." I really enjoyed the intro of the song, with a gentle guitar riff, which sets the tone for the entire piece, poetic and introspective. <!--more--> Despite the warped neck issue of my old Ovation guitar, I was determined to play it for the **last time**.

### About the Song

「**言って。**」is an emotional and powerful song that talks to the heart. It's a song about expressing yourself and opening out, which emphasizing the necessity of being truthful with yourself and others, even when it is difficult.

The intriguing blend of live-action footage and animation in the「**言って。**」music video was extremely enticing to me. The video depicts an animated girl who appears to be isolated from the world around her while also being liberated from its confines.

### About the Arrangement

In addition to my Ovation guitar's warped neck, I was having difficulty playing it, particularly while attacking mute. Because of the undesirable contact between the strings and the frets, the high frequency of the notes was too sharp and unpleasant.

This difficulty made achieving the tone I wanted difficult, and I had to change my playing approach and make some creative choices to work around it.

It's always difficult for a musician to say goodbye to an instrument that has been a part of their artistic journey for a long time. I had been playing an old Ovation guitar for years, but it had developed a warped neck problem that made it impossible to play. I knew I'd have to give up the guitar someday, but I wanted to use it one final time to produce an arrangement of a song I like once again.

*Thank you, and goodbye!*
