「海獣の子供」, popularly known as "Children of the Sea," is a Japanese animated picture that has had a lasting impact on me. While I struggled to understand the story's message due to the film's stream of consciousness writing style, I was completely enthralled by the film's gorgeous graphics and animation.

The degree of detail and richness in the images was incredible, and it's clear that the artists put their hearts and souls into each frame. I was struck by the sheer craftsmanship on display, and the way that the art elevated the story and gave it a tangible.


### About the Arrangement

I feel immensely grateful for the opportunities that my mother has provided me with, particularly when it comes to shooting music videos. Most recently, we had the chance to film a video on a beach near the **Monterey Bay** area.

Maintaining my posture and balance on the sand while sitting on a slim side up guitar case for the duration of the recording was one of the most difficult components of the shoot. It was exhausting, and I had to keep moving around to find a comfortable posture. But because of the particulars of the filming, it was an intriguing and worthwhile experience for me.

It was a wonderful experience to be on the beach, surrounded by the natural beauty of the ocean and the sounds of the waves lapping against the coast. It served as a timely reminder of the strength and beauty of nature and served as the ideal setting for the music video we were making.
